        <h1>Sify Discord Bot - Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date</strong>: 2024-01-05</p>
        
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By adding or using Sify on your Discord server, you agree to follow these terms. You also confirm that you meet Discord’s age requirement of being at least 13 years old.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these ToS at any time, and the changes will be posted in the official support server or website. Your continued use of Sify after changes to the terms signifies your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
        
        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree to use Sify only for lawful purposes and in accordance with Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>. Specifically, you agree:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not to use the bot to harass, threaten, or harm others.</li>
            <li>Not to abuse moderation commands (e.g., mass banning, muting without cause, etc.).</li>
            <li>Not to use Sify for the distribution of illegal, harmful, or malicious content.</li>
            <li>Not to automate commands in a way that disrupts the server or exploits the bot's features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Moderation Features</h2>
        <p>Sify includes a wide range of moderation features such as:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Deleting inappropriate or spam messages.</li>
            <li>Logging user actions and infractions for transparency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Bot Permissions</h2>
        <p>To function properly, Sify requires certain permissions, such as reading messages, banning users, and managing roles. By inviting Sify to your server, you grant these permissions. It is your responsibility to ensure that Sify has the necessary permissions to operate as expected.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Collection</h2>

        </ul>
        <p>Sify does not store personal information for any purpose beyond moderation logs. These logs may be used to assist with dispute resolution within the server but are not shared with third parties, except as required by law.</p>

        <h2>7. Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>We value your privacy and strive to protect any data collected through the use of the bot. Sify does not collect or store any sensitive personal information beyond what is needed for moderation features. All data is processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <li>Unauthorized use of moderation commands by server members.</li>
            <li>Any disruptions, errors, or bugs in the bot.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using Sify, you acknowledge that moderation actions (such as banning or muting users) are your responsibility and that we are not responsible for any consequences stemming from these actions.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>You can remove Sify from your server at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate Sify’s services, or revoke access to the bot, at our discretion and without prior notice, particularly in cases of misuse or violation of these terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms and any disputes that arise will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Lithuania. You agree to resolve any disputes with us in the courts located within [Insert Jurisdiction].</p>
