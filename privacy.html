            <li><strong>Logs:</strong> Logs of moderation actions, such as who performed an action (e.g., muting, banning) and when it occurred.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>Sify uses the data collected to perform moderation tasks and ensure a safe and well-organized Discord community. Specifically, we use your data to:</p>

            <li>Log moderation actions like muting, kicking, or banning users for server transparency.</li>
            <li>Track infractions and assist with dispute resolution between server members.</li>
